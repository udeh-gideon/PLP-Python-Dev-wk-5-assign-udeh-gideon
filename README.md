# Assignment 1 & 2 - Python OOP Practice

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including classes, constructors, attributes, methods, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

We designed a class called Smartphone ðŸ“± to represent a real-world device.

âœ… Features Implemented:

- Attributes: brand, model, storage, battery.

- Constructor (__init__) initializes unique values for each object.

Methods:

- make_call(number) â†’ Simulates making a call.

- install_app(app_name) â†’ Installs an app.

- battery_status() â†’ Displays remaining battery.

Inheritance:

- GamingPhone (inherits from Smartphone) with an added method play_game(game_name).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

We explored polymorphism by creating different vehicles that share the same method move(), but behave differently.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts Practiced

- Classes & Objects â€“ Designing reusable templates.
- Constructors (__init__) â€“ Initializing object state.
- Encapsulation â€“ Protecting data with private attributes.
- Inheritance â€“ Reusing and extending functionality.
- Polymorphism â€“ Shared method names with different behaviors.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone this repo or copy the code into a file, e.g., assignment.py.
2. Run the file in your terminal:
```bash
python assignment.py
```

---

## ðŸ“š Conclusion

This assignment successfully demonstrates Python OOP fundamentals through a practical example of a Smartphone class and a polymorphism challenge with vehicles.
